            <br>
Nashik has a rich history rooted in Hindu mythology, as it is believed to be the place where Lord Rama lived during his exile. The city has been known by various names throughout history, including Janasthan and Gulshanabad. In more recent history, the Peshwas controlled the city, giving it its modern name in 1818, but the British captured it the same year.
